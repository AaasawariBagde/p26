**ABOUT**

> Chicken Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.

> It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), and sometimes, in addition, eggs and/or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties.

> Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as parts of Afghanistan and Iraq.

> Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal.

> Biryanis have more complex and stronger spices compared to pulao.

> Biryani has a stronger taste of curried rice due to a greater amount of spices.
